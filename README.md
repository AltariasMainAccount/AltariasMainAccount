# Hello there!

My name is Altarium (or Altar). I am a software developer specializing in making software using mostly Javascript/Typescript.

Main Languages are deceiving as I don't actually publish the projects that I make in Javascript.

I usually push my newer projects that don't have to do with JS here.

Here are some fancy stats that are made using anuraghazra's readme stats repo:
